      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a hands-on Software Developer and Technical Support Specialist with 5 years of experience in application development and technical support. I am innovative, enthusiastic, and have uncompromising work ethic.</p>
 <br> <p>My career accomplishments consist of five years’ experience developing several web-based applications for a number of clients from concept (user research and wire framing included) to completion. I have developed sites for medium and large companies which has given me the skills to adjust to the changing dynamics and processes of those environments while meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables.I am a proven team player who enjoys working with others. My collaboration and problem-solving skills, along with my experience managing a team, allow me to excel in leading teams through projects.
